# Sabrina's project
This directory contains all the materials associated with Sabrina's replication.

## Motivation for study:
Determine whether morphological feature matching between the unpronounced material at the ellipsis site and its antecedent is relevant or not for ellipsis computation.

## Hypotheses

## Proposed methodology / design with example stimuli:

### Proposed methodology and design:

* The target material is elliptical structures with a 2x2 design. 
* The first factor is **_Match_**: the number or gender features on the subject of the second clause either matches or mismatches with the antecedent. Number and gender are separately tested.
* The second factor is feature markedness on the subject of the second clause (**_SSC_**): the SSC either has a marked feature (plural or feminine) or an unmarked one (singular or masculine).
* 80 sets of experimental items were constructed: in the first 40 sets, the gender feature was manipulated based on Match and SSC, while the number feature was kept constant on all arguments and predicates (i.e. singular). In the second set of 40 items, the number feature was manipulated while keeping the gender feature constant (i.e. masculine).
* For every condition, a non-elliptical version was included. These served as fillers.
* An additional 50 bi-clausal filler sentences were included. These were all ungrammatical due to subject-verb agreement errors.

### Example stimuli:

\- Elliptical Examples, Gender Set
1. Match, Unmarked SSC

El asistente es organizado y el jefe \[es organizado\] **también**.

the.m.sg assistant.m.sg is organized.m.sg and the.m.sg boss.m.sg is organized.m.sg **too**

2. Mismatch, Unmarked SSC

La asistenta es organizada y el jefe \[es organizado\] **también**.

the.f.sg assistant.f.sg is organized.f.sg and the.m.sg boss.m.sg is organized.m.sg **too**

3. Mismatch, Marked SSC

El asistente es organizado y la jefa \[es organizada\] **también**.

the.m.sg assistant.s.msg is organized.m.sg and the.f.sg boss.f.sg is organized.f.sg **too**

4. Match, Marked SSC

La asistenta es organizada y la jefa \[es organizada\] **también**.

the.f.sg assistant.f.sg is organized.f.sg and the.f.sg boss.f.sg is organized.f.sg **too**

\- Elliptical Examples, Number Set
1. Match, Unmarked SSC

the.m.sg fugitive.m is dangerous.m.sg and the.m.sg prisoner.m is dangerous.m.sg **too*

2. Mismatch, Unmarked SSC

Los fugitivos son peligrosos y el preso \[es peligroso\] **también**.
